BedWars1058-Ranked ADDON
This is an addon for the BedWars1058 plugin, adding the ranking system to your server.
It is an open-source addon, the modification is completely free to the user, I kindly ask not to modify the author, it's up to your ethics.

It is an extremely basic addon, without possible alterations and configurations, just install it on your server and test it.
As a dependency, we have BedWars1058, PlaceholderAPI, and BedWars1058-Stats.

For the plugin to work, just create the Ranked1v1 and Ranked4v4 modes (Only these are currently available).
